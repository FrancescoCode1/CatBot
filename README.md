# CatBot
This is my Discord Bot. I developed it to be more liberal about functionalities and add stuff id need more than one public bot for.

Currently it's divided into 3 parts
- 
- Fun commands like sending funny pictures of cats

- Music commands with Wavelink as a lavalink wrapper

- Soon: big moderation update which will include usual kick/ban/mute commands and extensive spam/raid protection

- You can type !help to see a list of all commands + description

How to run this bot
-
This bot is written in python using [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library. Additionally you'll need Java jdk13 and [Lavalink](https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink) for the music stuff.

If you host it yourself make sure to edit the linux stuff out. Hosting on cloud is strongly recommended
